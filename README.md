# Real-Estate-Mate-Firefox
Same as the original extension but packaged for Firefox

I'm not the author, I just packaged it as a Firefox extension. All credit goes to RickWillcox for creating the Chrome extension

To install, download the .xpi from the releases page, and in Firefox go to:

Menu -> Add-ons and themes -> Settings gearwheel icon -> Install Add-on From File
